## 📚 Assignment Questions

### Question 1 Achieving 1NF (First Normal Form) 🛠️
Task:
- You are given the following table **ProductDetail**:

| OrderID | CustomerName  | Products                        |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 101     | John Doe      | Laptop, Mouse                   |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Tablet, Keyboard, Mouse         |
| 103     | Emily Clark   | Phone                           |


- In the table above, the **Products column** contains multiple values, which violates **1NF**.
- **Write an SQL query** to transform this table into **1NF**, ensuring that each row represents a single product for an order

--- 

### Question 2 Achieving 2NF (Second Normal Form) 🧩

- You are given the following table **OrderDetails**, which is already in **1NF** but still contains partial dependencies:

| OrderID | CustomerName  | Product      | Quantity |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 101     | John Doe      | Laptop       | 2        |
| 101     | John Doe      | Mouse        | 1        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Tablet       | 3        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Keyboard     | 1        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Mouse        | 2        |
| 103     | Emily Clark   | Phone        | 1        |

- In the table above, the **CustomerName** column depends on **OrderID** (a partial dependency), which violates **2NF**. 

- Write an SQL query to transform this table into **2NF** by removing partial dependencies. Ensure that each non-key column fully depends on the entire primary key.

Good luck 🚀

Great! Here's your final SQL script that answers both questions step-by-step in a clean and structured format, just as requested:


---

-- Question 1: Transforming the Table into 1NF

-- Create the ProductDetail table
CREATE TABLE ProductDetail (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    Products VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert atomic values (each product gets its own row)
INSERT INTO ProductDetail(OrderID, CustomerName, Products)
VALUES
(101, 'John Doe', 'Laptop'),
(101, 'John Doe', 'Mouse'),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 'Tablet'),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 'Keyboard'),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 'Mouse'),
(103, 'Emily Clark', 'Phone');

Explanation: This table now satisfies 1NF because each field contains atomic (indivisible) values.


---

-- Question 2: Transforming the Table into 2NF

-- Create orders table (to store customer info separately)
CREATE TABLE orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert unique customer records
INSERT INTO orders (OrderID, CustomerName)
VALUES
(101, 'John Doe'),
(102, 'Jane Smith'),
(103, 'Emily Clark');

-- Create product table (linked to orders via foreign key)
CREATE TABLE product (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    productName VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INT,
    order_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(OrderID)
);

-- Insert product data with quantities and order linkage
INSERT INTO product(product_id, productName, quantity, order_id)
VALUES 
(1, 'Laptop', 2, 101),
(2, 'Mouse', 1, 101),
(3, 'Tablet', 3, 102),
(4, 'Keyboard', 2, 102),
(5, 'Mouse', 1, 102),
(6, 'Phone', 1, 103);

Explanation:
This design now satisfies 2NF:

CustomerName is moved to a separate table where it depends only on OrderID (not on the composite key).

All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the whole primary key in their respective tables.
